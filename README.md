## About

This project was inspired by the [original FTA Buddy](https://github.com/kenschenke/FTA-Buddy-Android) app made by Ken Schenke.
It has since evolved to have a more mobile friendly field monitor, custom flashcards, more information in the reference page, and a notes section for communicating with other FTA(A)s and CSAs at events.
The field monitor uses a Chrome extension installed on a computer on the field network to scrape data. The extension sends the data to a locally run server that broadcasts it to the app through a websocket. It also sends that data to the cloud server, that way you can give volunteers a portable field monitor without having them on the field network. Plus, having fewer SignalR connections is always a good thing.
The cloud server also enables the notes functionality. The notes are also persistent between events, so if you have a team with a weird problem you can leave a note and the FTA at their next event can benefit!

## Getting Started

- Install the extension from the [Chrome webstore](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fta-buddy/kddnhihfpfnehnnhbkfajdldlgigohjc)
- Go to [ftabuddy.com](https://ftabuddy.com/) on a computer connected to the field network.
- Click Host _and optionally login first_.
- Enter the event code (e.g. 2024miket) and a passcode of your choosing, and click create event
- Visit [ftabuddy.com](https://ftabuddy.com/) on your phone, add/install the web app to your home screen for the best experience
- Login or create an account for yourself, then connect to the event with the same code and pin!

- **_A way better_** event log viewer, give your CSAs access to the data that can help them help you help teams!
- Synced team checklist to help track radio programming
- Ticket and note system that's synchronized between events
- Current cycle will become more red as you approach 2x your average cycle time
- Last cycle time will be green if it's your best that event

**Coming soon:**

- Tracking connection time per team, and display 🕜 emoji when there's a team that takes 1 std deviation longer than the average team to connect

## Deployment

### SSE Subscriptions & HTTP/2

SSE subscriptions require **HTTP/2** in production so multiple browser tabs can
share a single multiplexed connection (HTTP/1.1 limits concurrent connections to
~6 per origin, which gets exhausted by long-lived SSE streams).

A [Caddyfile](Caddyfile) is included that:

- Terminates TLS and negotiates h2 via ALPN (automatic with Caddy's built-in ACME).
- Proxies `/trpc` to the Bun upstream with `flush_interval -1` (no response buffering for SSE).
- Proxies `/ws` for the Chrome extension's WebSocket connection.

```bash
# Install Caddy: https://caddyserver.com/docs/install
caddy run          # foreground, auto-HTTPS via Let's Encrypt
```

**Verify HTTP/2:** Open Chrome DevTools → Network tab → right-click column
headers → enable "Protocol". Subscription requests to `/trpc` should show `h2`.
